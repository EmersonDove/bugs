A list of things that you encounter in day to day life that shouldn't be messed with

1. Airport arrival times
    - The downside of missing your plane > the pain of waking up an extra hour early
2. Head injuries
    - Head injuries can leave no visible mark and basically end your life. The annoyance of putting on a helmet when
      biking or doing intensive things is irrelevant compared to the potential downside of being injured
      Sidenote, I've met a lot of people who get
      head injuries from motorcycles, I'm not putting motorcycles on the list because you can avoid them
      but they are also something to not mess with.
